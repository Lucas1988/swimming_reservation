### Swimming Reservation Bot

During the COVID-19 pandemic in The Netherlands, access to many services, including swimming pools have been restricted.
During some stages of the pandemic, swimming was only possible up to a maximum of 30 people simultaneously. An online reservation had to be made for this.
The demand for reservations was high, so we needed to be quick each time.
Therefore, I decided to automate the process and develop a bot for automatic reservations. There was nothing like an API, so I had to rely on browser
automation to make it work.
